# Dump execution

In the previous step, the network has reached  the  migration heights, and the final block hashes/heights of both chains are now revealed.<br/>
This section describes how the data, which includes all the balances to be migrated, was generated.<br/>

We will need to interact with a node of each chain:

- Fully synced ZEND Mainchain node 

- Fully synced EON Chain node with dump support enabled:

    - To enable dump support,  the following fragment must be present in the config file  (*important*: to generate a valid state dump, the fragment must be added *BEFORE* starting to sync the chain):

    ```
    evmStateDump {
        enabled = true
    }
    ```

    - If using Docker and the Docker image zencash/evmapp:1.5.0 , you can configure the following env property:

    ```
     SCNODE_EVM_STATE_DUMP_ENABLED=true
     ```

     This will set automatically the previous property in the container.

    
# How to obtain the dump data

<img  src="/img/migration2.png"/>

1. Execute a dump of ZEND balances at that specified height.
   ZEND is shipped with a dumper command line utility to do this:

    ```
    zen-cli stop
    dumper -H MC_MIGRATION_HEIGHT > utxos.csv
    ```

    Please note the following:
    - The stop command is needed because ZEND must not be running while performing the dump
    - If executing a dump of the testnet you must add the flag: -t
    - MC_MIGRATION_HEIGHT must be <b>not too old in the past</b> compared to the latest tip: maximum supported height is <b>tip-100</b>

2. Execute a dump of EON State:
  
   Execute the following call on the EON node:<br/>

   ```
    curl --request POST 'http://127.0.0.1:9085/ethv1' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'accept: application/json' -d '{ "jsonrpc":"2.0", "method":"zen_dump", "params":["0xbda76ab769c4e158f8e8add81bdf17c9d919fb54cd5e32f1c83cebdfc3dc363c","/zendata/eon.dump"], "id":1 }'  
    ```
    - First parameter of the method must be replaced by EON_MIGRATION_HASH
    - Second parameter is the local-path of the output dump.

# How to create the restore artifacts

3. Download and follow the README instructions of  [this folder](https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/horizen-migration/tree/dev/dump-scripts) to    execute the  *create_restore_artifacts.sh* bash script.

    The script will process the following data:
    - two previous full dumps
    - the list of the staked ZEN at the specific dump height, obtained by querying a running EON node
    - a list of ["auto mapped" addresses](https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/horizen-migration/tree/dev/dump-scripts/automappings): they are hardcoded mappings that comes from offchain agreements between selected partners (centralized exchanges) and HorizenLabs.

    The script will perform the following:

    - For ZEND:
        - transform the addresses in Base58 decoded format (is easier to handle in the solidity code), without chain prefix
        - transform the balances in "wei" format (1 ZEN = 1 with 18 zeros)
        - exclude the automapped addresses
        - order the addresses alphabetically

    - For EON:
        - filters out the smart contracts addresses and the stakes belonging to smart contracts
        - merge the EON staked ZEN to EOA balances
        - filters out addresses with 0 balance and no stakes
        - filters out the 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 account
        - transforms the balances in "wei" format (1 ZEN = 1 with 18 zeros)
        - include the automapped addresses
        - orders the addresses alphabetically

The result of the script will be two restore artifacts:

- a *zend.json* file, containing a key-value json data structure like this:

    ```
    {
        "0xabf1FF91cECD9990B3f29363B62B87FD76f55F4A": 10001500000000000000000,
        "0x448ae34180D03AD7da48975d6Fd7B297bb871E26": 2082100000000000000,
        "0x144e0FE5e69893577107a15a7c76bABd59f0A279": 100000000000000000
    }
     ```

     The *keys* represent the ZEND address in a Base58check decoded format, without the first 2 bytes chain prefix (so 20 bytes in total), prepended with 0x.<br/>
     The *values* represent the ZEND balance, in "wei format" (1 ZEN = 1 with 18 zeros).

- an *eon.json* file, containing a key-value json data structure like this:

    ```
    {
        "0xBa2290AEaAE3e1ea336431911C97a67Ebff46528": 1500000000000000000,
        "0xFEB3DE3D4A6F49bbF643c44E64dfd3e46D3E0F04": 821003000000000000,
        "0x2a085Ca4E931938Aa383C88026b0566cFce1A34b": 45500000000000000
    }
     ```

     The *keys* represent the EON address in the hex form with “0x” prefix.<br/>
     The *values* represent the EON balance, in "wei format" (1 ZEN = 1 with 18 zeros).

These artifacts will be the ones used for the data loading and migration check steps.

# Final restore artifacts
