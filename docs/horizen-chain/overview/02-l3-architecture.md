Horizen Chain is an OP Stack rollup that settles directly onto Base, which in turn settles onto Ethereum.


## The Layered Model

**Ethereum — Security & Final Settlement**: The root of trust. Ethereum provides the cryptographic finality that everything above it inherits.

**Base — Scalable Execution & Data Availability**: Horizen's settlement surface. Transaction data and state commitments from Horizen are published directly to Base's native data-availability layer.

**Horizen Chain — Horizen Chain — Capital Coordination & Execution:**: An EVM-compatible rollup using the OP Stack. Horizen inherits Base's scalability and sequencing infrastructure, with opt-in confidential execution available through VELA.

**VELA — Confidential Coprocessor**: An emerging confidential coprocessor that sits alongside Horizen Chain. Applications offload sensitive computation to TEE enclaves, receive cryptographically attested results back, and anchor those results on-chain.
