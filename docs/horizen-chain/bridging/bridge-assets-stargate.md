Stargate is a cross-chain liquidity protocol built on [LayerZero](https://layerzero.network). It is the primary bridge for ZEN, USDC.e, and cbBTC on Horizen, supporting transfers across 80+ chains.

ZEN and cbBTC use the LayerZero OFT (Omnichain Fungible Token) standard — burned on the source chain and minted on the destination. USDC uses Stargate's lock/mint model - USDC is locked on Base and USDC.e is minted on Horizen.


## Supported Tokens

The following tokens are supported on Horizen via Stargate:

| Token | Horizen Contract | Bridge Mechanism |
|-------|-----------------|------|
| ZEN | `0x57da2D504bf8b83Ef304759d9f2648522D7a9280` | OFT (burn/mint) |
| USDC.e | `0x3a1293Bdb83bBbDd5Ebf4fAc96605aD2021BbC0f` | Lock/Mint |
| cbBTC | `0x68fb5BB8330C0b9d907F50f278143873276ee056` | OFT (burn/mint) |

:::note
ZEN on Horizen and Base share the same OFT contract address (`0x57da2D504bf8b83Ef304759d9f2648522D7a9280`) — this is expected behavior for the OFT standard.

## Bridge via the Stargate UI

### Prerequisites

- A wallet with funds on your source chain (e.g., ETH for gas on Base or Horizen)
- The token you want to bridge

### Steps

1. Go to [stargate.finance](https://stargate.finance)
2. Connect your wallet
3. On the **Transfer** page, select your source chain and token
4. Select **Horizen** as the destination chain (or vice versa)
5. Enter the amount to bridge
6. Review the estimated fee and receive amount
7. Click **Transfer** and confirm the transaction in your wallet

Stargate offers two transfer modes:

- **Simple** - sends assets to your same connected wallet address on the destination chain. Use this for most cases.
- **Advanced** - lets you specify a custom destination address. Use this if you're bridging to a different wallet.

### Fees

Stargate charges a protocol fee of **0.06%** per transfer. You will also pay gas on the source chain. No gas is required on the destination chain.

### Transfer time

Most transfers complete in **under 2 minutes**, depending on source chain finality.


## Slippage

Stargate uses unified liquidity pools. For stable assets like USDC, slippage is typically negligible. You can configure slippage tolerance in **Advanced Settings** on the transfer page.

- **Low slippage (0.1%)** — protects against price changes but may cause the transaction to fail in low-liquidity conditions
- **High slippage (1–3%)** — more likely to succeed but you may receive slightly fewer tokens

For ZEN and cbBTC (OFT standard), slippage does not apply — the burn/mint mechanism guarantees you receive the exact amount minus the protocol fee.
